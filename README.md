# Neural Style Transfer

This project implements neural style transfer that applies style of one image to content of another image to generate artistic images. 

## Overview
* This project is an application of Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Network. Neural Style Transfer is a popular technique in Computer Vision and Image Processing.

* This project provides an implementation of Neural Style Transfer using Tensorflow and pre-trained InceptionV3 network. It allows you to experiment with different content and style image to generate unique artistic image.

## Examples

Here is one example of the stylised generated image using the project.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">Content Image</td>
     <td align="center">Style Image</td>
     <td align="center">Generated Image</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="NST/Images/content_image.jpg" width=340 height=300></td>
    <td><img src="NST/Images/style_image.jpg" width=340 height=300></td>
    <td><img src="NST/Images/generated_image.png" width=340 height=300></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
